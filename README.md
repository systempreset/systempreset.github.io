# Photography Portfolio v6

### Updates
- **Homepage grid**: capped to 2 columns on large screens, 1 column on small screens.
- **Mobile nav drawer**: slides over content from the left, darkens the underlying page, and uses a × close icon when open.
- **Overlay**: tap outside the nav to close it.

Deploy via GitHub Pages as before.
- Nav toggle now sits in page flow (top-left) and no longer overlaps content when closed.

- Nav toggle fixed top‑left; main content now offset so it no longer overlaps.

- Mobile nav now starts below menu icon; 'Jon Hewitt' link font size matches other items but remains bold.

- Mobile sidebar now spans full height (white) behind the close icon.

- Homepage cards now show subtitle lines; project order updated; project description narrowed to one column.

- Project descriptions aligned left.
- Project HTML filenames now use slugs matching titles (e.g., in-plain-sight.html).
